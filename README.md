HJA Columbine - landscape genetics
================

Woody plant encroachment into alpine meadows may reduce and fragment the habitat available to meadow plant communities. This could reduce population connectivity of alpine plant populations if seeds or pollen fail to disperse across forested areas, reducing effective population sizes, genetic diversity, and adaptive potential.

There are at least two mechanisms by which meadow fragmentation by forest encroachment could reduce the connectivity of meadow plant populations: **1)** a mechanism of *isolation-by-resistance* in which forest cover impedes pollen and/or seed dispersal to other meadows; **2)** the possibility that forest cover may reduce resource discovery for pollinators by concealing herbaceous plants, thereby reducing gene flow to plants overgrown by taller forest species.

Colleagues and I are testing these hypotheses using genetic data from 192 western columbine (*Aquilegia formosa*) plants across a forest-meadow mosaic landscape in the [H.J. Andrews
Experimental forest](https://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/). This repository documents all code used to analyze the data from our landscape genetics study. It includes a folder with

  - code used to process and prepare the genomic data
  ([*Data_processing](https://github.com/Dusty-Gannon/HJA_Columbine_landscape_genetics/tree/master/Data_processing))
  - code used to conduct the landscape genetics analysis
    ([*Analyses*](https://github.com/Dusty-Gannon/HJA_Columbine_landscape_genetics/tree/master/Analyses))
      - The primary analysis includes a [knitted pdf](https://github.com/Dusty-Gannon/HJA_Columbine_landscape_genetics/blob/master/Analyses/Edgeweight_estimation_gendist.pdf) of the code for readability
  - R code used to automate some processes for code readability and ease
